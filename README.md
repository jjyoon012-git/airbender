# üõ∞Ô∏è AIRBENDER : From EarthData to Personalized Action

**AIRBENDER** is a real-time, personalized air-quality intelligence platform that transforms **NASA TEMPO** satellite data into individualized forecasts and actionable guidance.  
Developed by **Team NAVI** for the **NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025**, it bridges space-based science and everyday life - helping people breathe safer, live smarter, and stay informed in real time.

---

## Overview

AIRBENDER turns NASA TEMPO Level-2 and Level-3 Version 3 data - including **NO‚ÇÇ, O‚ÇÉ, HCHO, and Cloud Fraction (CLDO4)** - into personalized, human-centric air-quality intelligence.  
Unlike conventional dashboards showing city-level indices, AIRBENDER adapts forecasts to each user's **location, routine, and health context**, combining cloud computing and large language models (LLMs) to deliver empathetic, actionable insights.

---

## What Exactly Does It Do?

AIRBENDER continuously retrieves and processes NASA TEMPO data through a cloud pipeline built on the **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**.  
It generates hourly nowcasts and short-term forecasts that are:
- Location-specific  
- Context-aware  
- Personalized to user profiles  

Based on these predictions, a **large language model (LLM)** converts scientific outputs into natural, human-like messages - adjusting tone, timing, and phrasing to fit each user‚Äôs lifestyle and preferences.

---

## How It Works

### 1. Data Acquisition and Preprocessing
- Connects to the **NASA Earthdata Cloud** using the *earthaccess API*  
- Retrieves TEMPO **NO‚ÇÇ, O‚ÇÉ, HCHO**, and **Cloud Fraction (CLDO4)** datasets  
- Filters by geographic coordinates (e.g., NYC: ‚àí74.3 to ‚àí73.6¬∞, 40.4 to 41.0¬∞)  
- Converts NetCDF ‚Üí structured time-series using *xarray* and *pandas*  
- Stores cleaned data in **Google Cloud Storage** with version control  

### 2. Forecasting and Personalization
- Uses a lightweight AI model on **Google Cloud Run**  
- Combines historical TEMPO data with meteorological covariates  
- Cross-references forecasts with each user‚Äôs encrypted metadata:
  - Occupation  
  - Outdoor exposure  
  - Commute schedule  
  - Health sensitivity  
- Produces individualized forecast layers for each user  

### 3. Context-Aware Communication
- Integrated **LLM (Qwen 2.5-VL)** generates human-like recommendations  
- Adapts message tone and timing dynamically  
- Sends alerts via push/email notifications (e.g., ‚Äú07:30 morning brief‚Äù, ‚Äú18:00 preview‚Äù)  

### 4. Continuous Improvement
- Modular design supports easy integration of:
  - **AOD (Aerosol Optical Depth)** data  
  - Ground-station PM‚ÇÇ.‚ÇÖ / PM‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ  
  - Future **TEMPO V04** products  
- Scalable architecture enables global deployment

## Benefits

### Personal Impact
- Provides **real-time, personalized forecasts** per user  
- Issues actionable, empathetic recommendations like  
  *‚ÄúDelay your commute by one hour for cleaner air.‚Äù*  
- Protects sensitive groups (children, elderly, respiratory patients)  
- Encourages preventive behavior (mask use, ventilation timing, exercise scheduling)  

### Social and Environmental Impact
- Makes NASA TEMPO data accessible and interpretable to the public  
- Supports **urban planners and local authorities** in identifying pollution patterns  
- Promotes data-driven awareness and community-level behavioral change  

### Scientific and Technological Contribution
- Demonstrates how **TEMPO L3 V03** can power citizen-facing AI services  
- Provides a reusable framework for merging satellite data + AI personalization  
- Fosters public engagement with NASA open data  

### Long-Term Vision
- Envisions a world where **everyone receives personalized environmental intelligence**  
- Expands beyond TEMPO to other satellite missions, connecting people globally to NASA‚Äôs Earth science ecosystem

## Project Goals

AIRBENDER aims to evolve into a **cloud-based environmental intelligence agent** -  
a personal assistant that interprets NASA Earth observation data in real time.  

It embodies the Space Apps theme **‚ÄúFrom EarthData to Action‚Äù** by turning complex atmospheric measurements into **personalized, meaningful actions** that empower individuals and communities to live sustainably.
